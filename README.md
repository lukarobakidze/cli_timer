# Pomodoro Timer

Hello, this is my first coded with typescript. It's primitive but I think it's a good starting point for me in TS.

A simple CLI timer for focus sessions and breaks.

## Features

- 30 minute focus timer
- 5 minute break timer
- macOS notifications when timer completes
- Sound alert when timer finishes

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

Start a focus session (30 minutes):
```bash
npm start focus
```

Start a break (5 minutes):
```bash
npm start break
```

## Requirements

- Node.js
- macOS (for notifications)
